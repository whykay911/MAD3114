    <h3>Rabbit and Carrots</h3>

    <p>Rabbits love Carrots, they eat in different ways. Working with third party vendors can be challenging and most importantly setting service level agreements to ensure terms of contracts are met. Human factor in many organizations and establishment affects output and outcomes despite putting systems, policies, contracts, mission, core value and visions in place. I often have a share of human factor affecting process for planned activities and projects, as a team lead in a fast-paced environment I coordinate team activities – managing projects, team members and third-party vendors. Its harder to manage external vendors as they have different sets of values that drive their organization and internal policies, on many projects I ensure have daily trackable tasks that are SMART, ensuring everyone are on the same page at close of business daily. Most importantly I have learnt to communicate more, understand individuals I am dealing with, build relationships in order not to see individuals as statistics or another obstacle to summon. I show I care before reaching for the hands even when its obvious that what they are being paid to do, deep down everyone wants to be treated right and not just an object to use.</p>

    <p>Another Paragraph - Understanding this always give me result until I had an encounter last year on a Workstation preventive maintenance and Inventory project with a specific vendor representative, he wasn’t responding to mails or calls to follow daily plans and reports, email reminders weren’t responded to, and I had to start escalation matrix with both internal and vendor’s leadership. Being assertive and consistent in my approach of communication brought attention of everyone to the project, which was clear I wasn’t getting traction with the vendor representative, this led to creating a new approach which marks out how to track third parties’ commitment and progress on project. A Specific timeline was set for response to mails with the vendor, it worked like magic and made the project a success following already set guides. I was awarded service excellence award for showing leadership beyond even beyond the organization. </p>
